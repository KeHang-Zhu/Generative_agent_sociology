# Generative Agent for few-people interpersonal study

## TODO
bargaining scenarios. E.g., imagine agents endowed with items and valuations over those items and then the possibility of them trading with each other.


## TODO
- Read the pre-GPT work
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-based_model#Applications

- Play with the simple 2-agent model

### Why Generative AI sociology
1. find new phenomena
2. looking at real-world phenomena
for example: by-stand effect,
does the effect exist for the agents.

How to intervene, when does this occur
within a small group of people, 5-10 people (Stanford town 11 people)

In real world, testing the intervention is very hard.
In the generative society, we can easily test it in different community by changing the parameters.

## TODO
- Make a list of effects revelent to 2-10 people.
- Make a overview of the field of social dynamics.

## Building Agent-based Models with GPT 4 and Netlogo
- They can contribute to the effective design of behavioural interventions.
- Source of fraction: 
  - require coding expertise
  - time-consuming process
