## Bargain 
bargaining scenarios. E.g., imagine agents endowed with items and valuations over those items and then the possibility of them trading with each other.

Reasons:
For (1), the creators of LLMs have designed them to respond in ways similar to how a human would react to prompts—including prompts that are economic scenarios. The design imperative to be “realistic”’ is why they can be thought of as com- putational models of humans. For (2), these models likely capture latent social information such as economic laws, decision-making heuristics, and common social preferences because the LLMs are trained on a corpus that contains a great deal of written text where people reason about and discuss economic matters: What to buy, how to bargain, how to shop, how to negotiate a job offer, how to make a job offer, how many hours to work, what to do when prices increase, and so on.


Title: Investigating Bargaining Behavior in Generative AI Agents

Objective: To analyze the bargaining behavior and strategies of two generative AI agents in a trading scenario.

Hypotheses:

AI agents with better communication and reasoning skills will be more successful in reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.
AI agents with a greater variety of bargaining strategies will be more adaptable and achieve better results in the bargaining process.
Experimental Design:

Participants:
Two generative AI agents (AI-Agent1 and AI-Agent2) will be used for this experiment.

Materials:

A dataset of items with assigned values
A communication platform for AI agents to interact and negotiate
A set of predefined bargaining strategies for AI agents
Procedure:
Step 1: Initialization

Generate a random list of items with assigned values. Each AI agent will have a set of items and valuations for each item.
Endow the AI agents with a range of bargaining strategies, including cooperative, competitive, and mixed strategies.
Assign each AI agent a specific negotiation style and adjust their communication capabilities accordingly.
Step 2: Bargaining Scenarios

Create a series of bargaining scenarios with different levels of difficulty, based on factors such as the number of items, their valuations, and the overall stakes involved.
For each scenario, set the initial conditions, such as the number of items, their initial distribution, and the AI agents' valuations.
Step 3: AI-Agent Interaction

Allow the AI agents to negotiate with each other using their respective bargaining strategies and communication skills.
Record the interactions and negotiations between the AI agents, including the offers, counteroffers, and final agreements.
Step 4: Evaluation

Assess the performance of the AI agents in each scenario based on a set of predefined criteria, such as the time taken to reach an agreement, the number of negotiation rounds, and the overall satisfaction of both parties.
Compare the performance of the AI agents in different scenarios and analyze the impact of their bargaining strategies and communication skills on the outcomes.
Step 5: Data Analysis

Analyze the collected data to test the hypotheses and identify patterns, trends, and relationships between the AI agents' bargaining strategies, communication skills, and negotiation outcomes.
Determine if the AI agents with better communication and reasoning skills are more successful in reaching mutually beneficial agreements, and whether those with a greater variety of bargaining strategies are more adaptable and achieve better results in the bargaining process.
Expected Outcomes:
The results of this experiment should provide insights into the effectiveness of different bargaining strategies and communication skills among generative AI agents. The findings could have practical implications for enhancing the negotiation capabilities of AI systems in various applications, such as e-commerce, customer service, and conflict resolution.
